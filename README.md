# SimpleApiHandler

Keep in mind that these files belong to a Unity project.

I am trying to develop a tablet application that allows its users to access airport relevant data stored in a database. The application has the typical three-tier architecture: client, server and database.

The client is developed in Unity, a video game development software that makes it easy to program graphical interfaces with buttons, fields, scrolling and related features.

The app has multiple tabs where an user can access different kind of data, such as information about flights, passengers, or airport employees. The users must be able to filter that data. Therefore:

The scripts in this respository are ment to take the GET request from the client and send them to an API that I have already developed.
